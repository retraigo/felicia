                Easwari Engineering College was instituted in the academic year
                1996 - 1997, with the Approval of Government of Tamil Nadu and
                AICTE, New Delhi. As per Govt., Regulations for aﬃliation,
                originally the college was aﬃliated to the University of Madras,
                subsequently; the college is aﬃliated to Anna University Chennai
                since 2002. Pursuing the philosophy of continuous learning, the
                Institution prepares the students to score creditably in the
                Academic sessions and also encourages them to develop their
                interpersonal and intrapersonal skills and attitudes to approach
                life with confidence.
